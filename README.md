# Linear Regression, Random Effects and Hierarchical Linear Analysis
In marketing we often encouter sales data that want to account for the promotion, competition and holiday effect on sales. Finance folks might also come across customer retension/activation problems where we try to understand how to best offer our performance, to the right customer, at the right time. Perhaps the best and the easiest place to start is a linear model, with a log transformation. 

Here I will show 2 exercises I did using linear models, from the most basic linear models to mixed effects, and how to preliminarily select the interactions, how to evaluate model efficiency and decide which model is better for particular situations.
